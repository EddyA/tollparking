Toll Parking library.

1. Choose your pricing policy when creating a TollParking object
2. Build your parking using addParkingSlot(...)/removeParkingSlot(...) APIs
3. Manage your parking using getParkingSlot(...)/releaseParkingSlot(...) APIs

Further improvements:
- Add .properties file to set up prices (instead of using constructors)
- Provide utils to build parking based on a structured file (xml/json)
